Shaderland
===

This project is a simple repo where I follow the [Book of Shaders](theboookofshaders.com) from Patricio Gonzalez Vivo, so **the main goal here is to get introduced** to a subject I wanted to "master" for actually a long time. So except if you're a shader-noob as I am today, **do not expect to find clean, innovative and neat shaders, it might actually be quite the opposite**, just saying :) 

At start, I guess this will be a thorough follow of the lessons we can find on Patricio's book, but then as I get more and more comfortable with writing **Shaders**, I'll surely be more experimenting.

My intent is to be able to write shaders in GLSL in order to:
- get solid foundations on how shaders work
- and then be able to use that knowledge whether it's about writing pure shaders in GLSL for [three.js](https://threejs.org) or build them whithin Unity's builtin ShaderGraph component.
- grasp the mathematical knowledge running around shaders and hopefully 3D in general.
